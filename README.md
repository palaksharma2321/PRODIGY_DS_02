# PRODIGY_DS_02

Welcome to my submission for Task 2 of the Data Science Internship at Prodigy Infotech. In this task, I have performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset provided, focusing on exploration of the relationships between variables and identify trends and patterns in the data.

## Data Set

The dataset used for this task is [Titanic_dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data). 

## Tools and Libraries used

- Google Colab
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlip & Seaborn for visualization

## Conclusion

In conclusion, this EDA process provided valuable insights into the distribution of the selected variable in the dataset. This analysis lays the foundation for further exploration and modeling tasks in the data science workflow.

Thank you for reviewing my submission!
